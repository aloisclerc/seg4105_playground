## Chapter 2

One of the most difficult aspects of software design that shaping up attempts to remedy is specificity. Other conventional methods such as wireframes can be too specific while simple descriptions can be too vague. Software developers need to be able to trust their instincts and adapt on the fly for minor details such as the details of specific UI components. Shape Up provides an compromise where the big picture ideas are drawn up and visualized without committing too hard on the minor details. A fat marker sketch allowed Basecamp to decide on what their calendar would look like and the breadth of features it would include. Beyond that, the specifics are dependent on what the developer thinks is reasonable given the time and scope. While the shaping of the calendar was rough, it is also completely solved with every major feature identified and displayed.

## Chapter 3

Software developers are often ambitious passionate people with big appetites. While this enthusiasm is nice and helps productivity, appetite must be tempered appropriately or else projects can be stretched out for years and add features that weren't requested for or required. To solve this, projects are divided into Small-batch(1-2 programmers for 1-2 weeks) vs Big-batch(1-2 programmers for 6 weeks). Additionally, it's important to contextualize every new feature or change so that their size and scope is understood by everyone and ambitious dreams dont stretch out projects.

In order to reduce the scope and appetite, it's important to not take customer requests at face value and attempt to find the root of the problem. Often there is a simpler, faster to implement solution than the one requested by the customer, but this solution can only be identified if proper shaping work is done to truly understand the problem. At every stage of design, the shaper should be asking themselves "how is this feature solving the problem" repeatedly asking themselves this question can trim the fat off of a feature and save time and money

## Chapter 4

This chapter discusses the actual act of creating the actual design for a feature. At this stage in the design, it's not important that anyone understands the design other than the direct people involved. Documenting the design will come later.
There are two main forms of design that are often used together in shaping. The first is Breadboarding. In order to breadboard, you mock up the Places(screens, pop ups), Affordances(buttons, checkboxes, ui elements), and connection lines(how places and affordances connect) and nothing else. This avoids committing to visual design decisions too early. With breadboarding, the placement, look, or feel of each screen has not been decided, but the flow and functionality is clear. Thinking of only the flow allows designers to create an optimal design without inhibiting the actual developers designing the page.

The second technique is Fat Marker Sketches. Fat Marker Sketches allow the designers to create a more visual design without splitting hairs over details. In a Fat Marker Sketch, a literal fat marker is used to ensure that you cannot put too much detail on a page and that things must be kept simple. In addition, you cannot write actual words on a fat marker sketch to avoid designing small details. While breadboarding designs the overall flow of the feature, fat marker sketches display a general orientation and layout as well as laying out where certain features will be available on a page.

## Chapter 5

One of the biggest dangers in the shaping process is holes. Holes are huge hazards that can burn large amounts of budget. Identifying holes in the design phase can spare the software developers many hours. It is important to identify any ambiguous cases or contradictory designs before the feature is bet on. Since it's not necessary to bet on every feature that is shaped, if holes are identified in the shaping process, and no solution to the hole is found, the team can simply decide not to bet on the feature and save 6 weeks of dev time. It's also important at this step to outline boundaries for the dev team. If the boundaries are not clear, the dev team might take too much on their plate and stretch past their 6 week time frame.
